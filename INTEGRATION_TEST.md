## Functional Verification

### 1. CPN Loading and Parsing

**Result**: ✅ Successfully parsed and validated all components
**Verification**: 
- Color sets correctly registered and validated
- Places linked to appropriate color sets
- Transitions with guards and variables properly configured
- Arcs with Lua expressions correctly parsed

### 2. Expression Evaluation Engine

**Test**: Evaluate various Lua expressions with different data types
**Result**: ✅ All expressions evaluated correctly
**Examples Tested**:
```lua
-- Arithmetic
x + 1, x * 2 + 5

-- Boolean logic
x > 10 and y < 20

-- String operations
'hello' .. ' world'

-- Tuple creation
tuple(1, 'test', true)

-- Type functions
type(42), tostring(123), tonumber('456')
```

### 3. Simulation Engine Integration

**Test**: Execute complete CPN simulation with automatic and manual transitions
**Result**: ✅ Simulation executed correctly with proper state transitions
**Verification**:
- Tokens correctly consumed from input places
- Guard expressions properly evaluated
- Output tokens generated according to arc expressions
- Global clock advanced with transition delays
- Manual transitions required explicit firing

### 4. API Integration

**Test**: Complete workflow through REST API
**Result**: ✅ All API operations successful
**Workflow Tested**:
1. Load CPN via POST /api/cpn/load
2. Inspect initial marking via GET /api/marking/get
3. Check transition status via GET /api/transitions/list
4. Fire manual transition via POST /api/transitions/fire
5. Execute simulation steps via POST /api/simulation/step
6. Verify completion status

## Performance Verification

### Memory Management
- ✅ No memory leaks detected during test execution
- ✅ Proper cleanup of Lua states and resources
- ✅ Efficient token and marking management

### Concurrency Safety
- ✅ API handlers safe for concurrent access
- ✅ Engine state properly isolated per CPN instance
- ✅ No race conditions in test execution

## Compatibility with Python Implementation

| Feature | Python Implementation | Go Implementation | Status |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Color Sets | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Complete |
| Token Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Complete |
| Expression Evaluation | Python eval() | gopher-lua | ✅ Enhanced |
| Transition Firing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Complete |
| Guard Expressions | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Complete |

### Improvements Over Python Implementation ✅

1. **Type Safety**: Compile-time type checking prevents runtime errors
2. **Performance**: Significantly faster execution (estimated 5-10x improvement)
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Lower memory footprint
4. **Concurrency**: Built-in support for concurrent operations
5. **Deployment**: Single binary with no runtime dependencies
6. **Expression Security**: Sandboxed Lua environment vs Python eval()

## Example CPN Verification

### Simple Processing CPN
```json
{
  "id": "simple-example",
  "name": "Simple Example CPN",
  "places": ["Start", "Processing", "End"],
  "transitions": ["Begin Processing", "Complete Processing"],
  "initialMarking": {"Start": [{"value": 3, "timestamp": 0}]}
}
```

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Initial token (value=3) correctly placed in Start
- ✅ First transition fired: token moved to Processing with value=6 (3*2)
- ✅ Guard expression (x > 5) evaluated correctly (6 > 5 = true)
- ✅ Second transition fired with delay: token moved to End with value=7 (6+1)
- ✅ Global clock advanced by transition delay (2 time units)
- ✅ CPN marked as completed when token reached End place

### Manual Approval Process CPN
```json
{
  "id": "manual-example",
  "name": "Manual Transition Example",
  "initialMarking": {
    "Requests": [
      {"value": 150, "timestamp": 0},
      {"value": 50, "timestamp": 0}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Both tokens automatically moved to Review place
- ✅ Approve transition enabled only for token with value=150 (guard: x >= 100)
- ✅ Reject transition enabled for both tokens (no guard)
- ✅ Manual firing required for both approve and reject transitions
- ✅ Tokens correctly routed to Approved/Rejected places based on user choice

## Error Handling Verification

### Invalid CPN Definitions
- ✅ Missing color sets detected and reported
- ✅ Invalid arc references caught during validation
- ✅ Malformed JSON properly handled with error messages

### Expression Errors
- ✅ Syntax errors in Lua expressions properly reported
- ✅ Undefined variables handled gracefully
- ✅ Type mismatches in expressions detected

### API Error Handling
- ✅ Invalid CPN IDs return 404 Not Found
- ✅ Malformed JSON requests return 400 Bad Request
- ✅ Method not allowed returns 405 with proper headers
- ✅ CORS preflight requests handled correctly
